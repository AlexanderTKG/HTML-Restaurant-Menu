# Activity: Restaurant Menu

This project is the basic implementation of useing html and css

On the homepage you'll have a image of the restaurants name

You'll see a Dine in Buttom when you click on. It will lead you to the menu page
Underneath that page it will show you the items and prices of the restaurant menu.

On the about page it will show you a glimmer of what we offer.

Dont know when the restaurant opens/closes on the contact page
We list all the time and days that we're open
and a phone number if you want to contact the restaurant directly to create a reservation or any concerse you have
